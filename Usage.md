![NeuroCoCoon - Neuromorphic Computing CoCoon](assets/ncc_title_full.png)

# Overview

**NeuroCoCoon** is a **protective** development environment and experimentation **workbench** for
spiking neural networks (*SNN*s) running on **neuromorphic hardware**.

The network is described in a graph-based visual language and is built from **neuron populations** (nodes) and **synapse
connectors** (edges). User-defined **neuron types** and **synapse types** ensure consistent parameter choices for all
related parts of the network architecture. In addition, predefined **network modules** can be used as architectural
building blocks with external connection points (ports).

Networks can be simulated on the [NEST][NEST] software simulator, if NeuroCoCoon is running as a local application,
or on the [SpiNNaker and BrainScalesS][HBP-NMC] platforms of the European Horizon 2020 [Human Brain Project][HBP] (*HBP*),
if NeuroCoCoon is running as a client side web application inside the [HBP collaboratory][HBP-Collab].
